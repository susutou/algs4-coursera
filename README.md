==============

This repository is my solution for Coursera's algorithm class (by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick).

I am trying to make sure that each solution is well crafted and passes all tests (100/100) in the grading system,
even including the bonus round.

**Note:** Please do not use my code directly as the answer to the course, that is plagiarism and violates the ethic code
of Coursera.
